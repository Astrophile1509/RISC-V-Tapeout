# RTL Design and Synthesis


Welcome to **Week 1**, this week is focused on Verilog RTL design, simulation, synthesis, and digital circuit optimization. This repository is structured into multiple days, each with its own practical labs, code examples, and explanations.


---

## Over-View of Week 1

- Verilog RTL design and simulation
- Using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave for simulation and waveform analysis
- Logic synthesis using Yosys and the SKY130 open-source PDK
- Key digital design concepts: testbenches, timing libraries, D flip-flop coding styles, and optimization techniques

## Repository Structure

This Repository is organized by day, each with a dedicated folder and README:

- [Day 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis](https://github.com/Astrophile1509/RISC-V-Tapeout/blob/main/Week1/Day1/Readme)
- [Day 2: Timing Libraries, Synthesis Approaches, and Efficient Flip-Flop Coding](https://github.com/Astrophile1509/RISC-V-Tapeout/tree/main/Week1/Day2/Readme)
- [Day 3: Combinational and Sequential Optimization](https://github.com/Astrophile1509/RISC-V-Tapeout/tree/main/Week1/Day3/Readme)
- [Day 4: Gate-Level Simulation (GLS), Blocking vs. Non-Blocking in Verilog, and Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch ](https://github.com/Astrophile1509/RISC-V-Tapeout/blob/main/Week1/Day4/Readme)
- [Day 5: Optimization in Synthesis ](https://github.com/Astrophile1509/RISC-V-Tapeout/tree/main/Week1/Day5)

Each dayâ€™s README includes:
- Clear explanations of the dayâ€™s concepts
- Step-by-step practical labs with code and screenshots
- Tips and best practices for RTL design
