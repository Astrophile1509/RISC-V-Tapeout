Welcome to my journey through the **RISC-V SOC TapeOut Program**!  
This repository documents my **weekly** with tasks inside each week.  

"In this program, we learn to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. Part of India‚Äôs largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, empowering 3500+ participants to build silicon and advance the nation‚Äôs semiconductor ecosystem"
